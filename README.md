On Windows you may need to use MinGW or similar tools to make sure there is `gcc` in the `PATH`.

Only SQLite database tested in production.
You can also connect other database vendors either through ODBC or through native Go driver: Microsoft SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2 (ODBC only), Oracle (ODBC only).
To enable ODBC support please re-build Go executable(s):

```
go install -tags odbc,sqlite_math_functions,sqlite_omit_load_extension ./dbcopy
go install -tags odbc,sqlite_math_functions,sqlite_omit_load_extension ./dbget
go install -tags odbc,sqlite_math_functions,sqlite_omit_load_extension ./dboms
```
